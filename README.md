## Some of my Projects

#### [DisasterPipeline]
The goal of this project was to build a machine learining model to classfiy twitter messages that are send during disasters. Steps included building a basic ETL and ML pipeline as well as a Web-App to display statistics using graphical plots.

#### [UrbanObjectDetection]
One of my first larger machine learning projects. I trained a SSD Resnet model using the waymo open dataset to detect cars, pedestrians and cyclists. This also involved extensive exploratory data analysis and the application of different data augmentation strategies.

#### [Irc]
This is a simple IRC chat server based on the RFC 2812 written in C++. It can be used with most IRC clients to participate in chat rooms, send private messages and it allows for the management of access modes and permissions.

#### [Containers]
My personal implementation of some of the container class templates from the C++ standard template library (STL). This also included the corresponding iterator systems as well as the required utilities.
